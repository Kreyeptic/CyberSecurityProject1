So I noticed in the player win/loss during these times was Mylie Schidt and her dealer at the time was Billy Jones during her 13 times of winning.
My specific reasons were because in each doument we had showed Mylie winning during these times and we made a bash script to show us her Roulette dealer during these times and they all led us back to Billy Jones, so we're assuming Billy Jones and Mylie schmidt
were rigging the system to make profit from each of Billy Jones' shift he was working and to scam Lucky Duck.
