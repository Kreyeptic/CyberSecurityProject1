The files below have personally been tested and used to build a ELK web server on Azure. 
Below files are ansible-playbooks that you need to recreate DVWA and the ELK server.

[pentest.yml.txt](https://github.com/Kreyeptic/CyberSecurityProject1/files/7403976/pentest.yml.txt)
[filebeat-playbook.yml.txt](https://github.com/Kreyeptic/CyberSecurityProject1/files/7403977/filebeat-playbook.yml.txt)
[install-elk.yml.txt](https://github.com/Kreyeptic/CyberSecurityProject1/files/7403978/install-elk.yml.txt)
[metricbeat-playbook.yml.txt](https://github.com/Kreyeptic/CyberSecurityProject1/files/7403979/metricbeat-playbook.yml.txt)

These .yml files give you the following ansible files needed to recreate rules to configure your own DVWA, ELK, Filebeat and Metricbeat for Kibana.
